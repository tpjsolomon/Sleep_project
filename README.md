# Sleep_project
This repository contains the R code used to analyse the effects of melatonin and binaural beats on sleep duration and sleep quality. The analysis includes testing for normality and heterogeneity of variance and compares treatments arms using one-way ANOVA. Machine learning algorithms are also used to determine the predictors of sleep duration and sleep quality.
